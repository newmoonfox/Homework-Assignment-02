CSS and BootStrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

In order to create a "responsive" portfiolio I am:

1. Creating HTML documents: index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html
2. Using *bootstrap* to recreate navigation bar, a responsive layout and responsive images.
3. Utilizing what I learned in the activities from the student facing repository.
