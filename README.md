CSS and BootStrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

In order to create a "responsive" portfiolio I am:

1. Creating HTML documents: index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html
2. Using bootstrap to recreate navigation bar, a responsive layout and responsive images.
    - Bootstrap resources:
        * CSS style sheet to utilize -> rows and columns
        * Navigation Bar
        * Image-Cards to create gallery
        * Using "form" code from bootstrap to create a contact form.
3. Making a stylesheet/css document to add style to bootstrap code.
4. Utilizing what I learned in the activities from the student facing repository.
